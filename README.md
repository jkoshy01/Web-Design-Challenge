# Web-Design-Challenge
Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Objective:

Let's explore what we had learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.


Before You Start:


Clone the new repository to your computer. a new repository for this project called Web-Design-Challenge. Then you will clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, add your html files, as well as your assets, Resources and visualizations folders. Your index.html should be the landing page that the user first sees.

Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this assignment you will be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment.
we'll be plotting weather data. You will be building in this dashboard, create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them.


Website Requirements
For reference, see the "Screenshots" section below.
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.




A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint

The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here
